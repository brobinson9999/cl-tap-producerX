- No longer loads split-sequence via ASDF - just loads the .lisp file directly.

- Miscellaneous Bug Fixes and Tweaks

- Additional plist key/value pairs can now be specified when using is. This allows a test name to be set manually.

- The comparison function used to test for equality can now be specified using the structured-test properties :compare-sym and :compare-fun.

- Changed to always indent diagnostic lines, rather than only indenting them if they aren't already indented. This better preserves indentation in the diagnostic data itself. The presentation of multi-line values for YAMLish attributes can probably still be improved further.
